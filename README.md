Generate a sound file from an image

Jupyter notebook that takes an image, processes it into a format that can be read as a fourier spectrogram, and then uses that fourier spectrogram
to build a .wav file.

WARNING: The sounds this script generates can be very high pitched and are likely to cause discomfort to users with sensitive hearing or other sensitivity to intense audio.
